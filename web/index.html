	<h2>Welcome to our site! <br>
		We are a group of University of Toronto researchers 
		investigating methane gas emissions in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA).</h2>
	<div class="text-section">
		<h3>Overview</h3>
		Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas with a <b>warming potential 
		about 30 times that of carbon dioxide (CO2).</b> In order to reduce methane emissions in the 
		Greater Toronto Area, we must first know two things: how much methane we are emitting, and 
		where methane emissions are coming from. The GTA Urban Emissions Project works to answer 
		these two questions by analyzing existing methane emissions data and taking our own methane 
		measurements via a mobile laboratory. Although we try to measure methane at a variety of 
		sites around the GTA, there are areas we have missed, and we benefit greatly from the 
		perspective of citizens familiar with these areas. No matter where in the GTA you live, 
		<b>we need your feedback and ideas</b> about methane enhancements (unusually high levels of methane) 
		in your area.
		<h3>What can I find on this site?</h3>
